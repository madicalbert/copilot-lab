# Github Copilot Lab

Designed for use in ESM 244 at the Bren School of Environmental Science.

## Keys

Really more of structures to remind users where to go. Copilot presumably will generate students slightly different codes and suggestions

## Data

Data comes from the same ESM 244 Week 9 lab on clustering to introduce students to CoPilot with material they are familiar with.

The Second part of lab uses simulation data from a single user fishery with index insurance and monitors their behavior change.
